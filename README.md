default databases for Dungeon Craft

These are the 8 databases required for each Dungeon Craft design. These are text files that must be imported via the Database Editor -> Import/Export.

These are made available for designers to use as a base for their own work. They may be used in whole or in part as the designer sees fit.

Thesse databases try to emulate those for the 1993 SSI game, Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures (FRUA), with further additions from the 1st edtion rules of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (which is what FRUA is based on).
